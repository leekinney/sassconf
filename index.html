                    <aside class="notes">
                        So I'm not going to talk so much about Sass today but some fundamentals that, when not in place underneath all the beautiful shiny things you can do with Sass may be creating a terrible experience for certain users. The users I'm going to talk about today are the users that might not use a website the way I do or you do. Users that might not use a mouse or need to speak commands to navigate or the users who can't see your awesome designs at all. I may be repeating things you already know inside and out and things you are already aware of and considering with every build and I hope that is the case. But I think it's important to take a step back from some of the really cool, cutting edge stuff, the things that might only work in certain browsers or solve some really awesome, hypothetical issue of the future. Those types of talks are really interesting and important. But I think it's also really important to sometimes take a step back and revisit some fundamentals of web design and make sure we're providing a great experience for everyone using the web. We should never assume anyone is using our site the same way as the next person, visiting on the latest release of our favorite browser or worst of all that we are in a position to decide that some people should be able to access certain information and others should not.

                        Today, it is impossible to perform daily tasks without using the web. Not only do we need the web for convenience, i.e booking a flight in minutes and having a list of options in front of you to compare from instead of calling to book, most likely not getting the friendliest customer service rep or being put on hold for close to an hour. We can have groceries delivered to our house which is convenient for someone in an urban environment who may not have a car or a parent with children who works full-time during the week and doesn't want to take anymore time away from the time they have to spend with their children to make a 2 hour trip to the grocery store. This service specifically benefits someone who is blind and may need to arrange transportation along with someone to help them shop to perform a mundane task. We can now have immediate access to test results or a patient portal, or refill a prescription online. There are endless amounts of information and educational resources on the web that can allow someone to go back to school at night or learn something like web development. In turn helping them find better opportunities, a higher salary or the convenience of being able to work from home. As designers and developers, it is our responsibility to ensure we’re providing the same access to these necessary things to everyone.

                        So after looking at the staggering numbers of people who possibly can’t use our sites why isn’t everyone concerned about this? Why isn’t everyone creating accessible websites that can reach and benefit as many people as possible? Expanding the use of these sites to as many people as possible to sell more, educate more or help more?

                    <aside class="notes">
                        Building accessible websites can be expensive if it wasn't a consideration in the beginning. If we're going back and refactoring a ton of code and needing to rebuild other functionality of the site to be accessible than yes, it can get a little costly. The same can be said for buildings where the architect didn't consider accessibility in the beginning and the contractor now has to go back, maybe years later, add try to add in a ramp or an elevator.

					<h2>We’re lazy</h2>
					<blockquote cite="http://searchservervirtualization.techtarget.com/definition/Our-Favorite-Technology-Quotations">
						&ldquo;A lazy programmer will find tools that help him stay lazy instead of creating a tool himself, preferring to take advantage of the efforts of the open source community. If there is an existing solution that has already been tested and proven, this programmer will find it—and once again, his laziness has actually streamlined productivity.&rdquo;

                    <aside class="notes">
                        So back to some of our excuses. We're lazy. Being lazy isn't always a bad thing. If laziness helps up to create a better solution for something or to avoid redundancy and repetitiveness than being lazy can be a great thing and something we can use for our benefit. Sass, for example, is a better, more efficient way to write CSS and avoid redundancy and repetitiveness and there are many ways we can use Sass to help quickly create accessible sites.

                    <p class="fragment">So let's make an intentional effort to fix it.</p>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        And finally, the reason I think most inaccessible sites exist, is because it's unintentional. I’ve had the opportunity to speak about a11y over the past year or so and always loved the discussion that came after. I really found that most des/dev just didn’t realize some of the choices they were making were detrimental to a user’s experience. I would get annoyed when I saw inaccessible sites but then began to realize that a lot of the time it really was unintentional. We often don’t think about certain things unless we are directly affected by it. There isn’t a way to analyze the amount of users coming to our sites using assistive technology which can sometimes make the argument for making accessible sites difficult.

                        </ul>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        Hopefully you will think a little differently when you're building your sites now or you are someone who is already doing this but another important thing I wanted to touch on quickly is keeping accessibility in mind offline. In our community we are constantly learning and sharing knowledge. Whether it's through classes, Meetups or conferences. People with disabilities are often barred from participation in physical spaces so hopefully you will consider this as well. If you’re scheduling an event, think about things like a ramp or ______, you can always ask attendees beforehand if they will require special assistance letting them know they are welcome and have the ability to attend. Small steps like these help to create a more inclusive and diverse community, which in the end everyone benefits from.

                        These are a few tools and extensions I like to use to quickly audit sites for accessibility. These tools won't catch everything and are never as good as human testing but they are a great way to get started. If you work on a Mac you already have a screen reader built in and can press command F5 to get started. I urge you to learn just a few commands and listen to your websites the way a blind user would. It's incredibly frustrating if the site wasn't built with A11Y in mind and is really eye opening. Another super quick audit? See if you can tab through your sites without ay issue or zoom into without the site breaking and still have the ability to navigate easily.
